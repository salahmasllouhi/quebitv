 * Unregistering it here takes its 145 posts off the front end and out of the
 * Rank Math sitemap while leaving the ACF definition untouched, so the section
 * can be brought back by removing this file.
 *
 * The posts are moved to draft as well, once, guarded by an option: without
 * that, re-registering the type later would silently republish 145 URLs.
